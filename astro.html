                    <h1>Astrophysics</h1>
					<hr>	
					<p><strong>Solar system</strong>: 8 planets (remember order of position, relative sizes, gaseous giants with small rocky core JSUN), <strong>Asteroids</strong> are millions of rocky objects of various sizes from 300 Km to 1000 Km between MJ orbiting sun, believed to have falled to form planets. <strong>Satellites</strong> are the moons of planets orbiting tn circle (formed by ejection of material after the collision between cosmic objects with solid planets- two for mars or asteriods pulled by gravity- 50 for jupiter), <strong>Meteorites</strong> are the Asteroid-like small debris entering earth's atmosphere burn away due to heat generated out of friction offered by air leaving a long bright tail. These are refered to as shooting star in common language. <strong>Comets </strong>are basically frozen gas on a solid core (believed to originate from Kuiper belt or Oort cloud), periodically orbiting sun hence visiting earth, wlll being to vaporize while approchlng sun (due to Increase in temperature) leaving a tail extending to millions of Km. <strong>Kuiper belt</strong> is much beyond Pluto, contains thousands of rocky objects that are too cold, hardly emit any radiation, so cannot be properly seen, source of comets and dwarf planets. <strong>Stars</strong> like the Sun, are mainly composed of hydrogen, and are sources of energy -fusion reaction produces outward radial radiation pressure which is countered by Inward radial gravitational pressure, when these two pressures are equal the star is in hydrostatic equlibrium for billions of years in main sequence. </p>

					<p><b>The nature of stars-</b> 
					The stability of a star depends on the equilibrium between two opposing forces. The equilibrium depends on the gravitation which can collapse the star and the radiation pressure which can make the star expand. This equilibrium is gained through nuclear fusion which provides the energy the star needs to keep it hot so that the star’s radiation pressure is high enough to oppose gravitational contraction. Apart from single stars like the Sun, there are many types of stars in our universe.</p>

					<p><b>Astronomical distances-</b>
					Our universe is composed of mostly empty space with occasional encounters of matter apart large distances.
					A light year is a unit of measurement of ultra-solar system distances. It’s the distance traveled by light in one year. The speed of light is 3*10^8m/s. You can find out the number of seconds in a year by multiplying the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (60), then multiplying that by the number of hours in a day (24) and multiplying that by the number of days in a year (approximately 365.25). One light year is thus approximately equivalent to 9.46 x 10^15m, which is also approximately equivalent to 0.3068 parsecs (pc).
					Example: The distance to the nearest star other than the Sun (Proxima Centauri) from the Earth is 4.31 light years, which is equivalent to 1.3pc. This means that it would take 4.31 years to send or receive a message to/from Proxima Centauri by electromagnetic wave transmission.
					The average distance between stars in a galaxy is approximately 1 pc, which is equivalent to 3.26 light years. The average distance between galaxies within the same cluster ranges from 100 kpc (kiloparsecs) to several hundred kpc. Galaxies in different clusters can be up to a few mpc (megaparsecs) apart. 1 mpc is equivalent to 1000 kpc.</p>
					<p><b>Stellar parallax and its limitations</b>
					Stellar parallax is a term used to describe the distance between two objects in space. When an observer on Earth photographs a relatively nearby star against a background of distant stars on two different occasions six months apart, the target star image will appear to have shifted against the more distant stellar background.
					The baseline shift of the observer on Earth is 2 astronomical units (AU). By convention, calculations are normalized to one AU, the radius of the Earth’s orbit, so one half of the measured shift in apparent position is deemed the “parallax” of the target.
					A parallax of one arc-second is called a parsec. Since we know, the radius of the Earth’s orbit, simple Euclidean geometry allows us to calculate that a star exhibiting a one arc-second shift is 3.26 light years or one parsec away from Earth.
					However, if a star is too far away from Earth, its parallax will be too small to be measured with accuracy.</p>

           			</figure>
           			<p><b>Luminosity and Apparent Brightness-</b> The total power radiated by a star in all directions is known as its luminosity and the SI unit for luminosity is watts ( W ). When you compare this to the power received by an observer on the Earth, you can see that the two quantities are quite different. The power received per unit is known as the star’s brightness and this is measured in watts per metre squared (W/m^2).
					If two stars were at the same distance from Earth, the one that had the greatest luminosity would also have the greatest brightness. However, because stars are at different distances from the Earth, their brightness will depend on the luminosity as well as the distance from Earth. The luminosity of a star will decrease with distance according to the inverse square law.</p>
